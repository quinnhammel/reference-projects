This project was for keeping track of finances for debate, specifically using the site tabroom. 
It was a requirement that the output be put into an excel file for the coach, so that part is a bit verbose. 
In general this project allowed me to play with more complex data structures in python, such as mutually recursive structures. 
Much of the DataStructures file has to do with methods of preventing duplicate items beuing erroneously entered by the user.
